Allow me to start with a story. During this summer I had the chance to spend a
few short hours at Riker's Island Correctional Facility together with a select
group of students and collogues, which on at least one occasion included
Bernard's partner, Mia. We were there ostensibly for an educational program.
Our project, Rikers Bot, combined a programming workshop and a storytelling
group. More importantly, we were there to spend time with the young people of
Rikers. It was an encounter with the penal system in the midst of our
community. Even in the best of times, entering Rikers is not easy. One goes
through a series of gates and checkpoints. One laminated card is exchanged for
another. The guard stamps an infrared mark on your wrist. But the jail is also
not what you would expect from the Focouldian image of the panoptic. Where one
would expect total surveillance, we were all struck by the dilapidated,
abandoned almost feel of the grounds. At one point, a young guard, not in
uniform yet, on the way to start her shift, ushered us in quickly and probably
against protocol. She led us through rooms filled with well-used riot gear,
break rooms, hallways lined with posters about job safety, potlocks,
fundraising notices. Charity foot game. Guards eating lunch by the staircase.
We were on the way to a wing of the building which housed classrooms. But at
some point, while walking up a staircase, our guide ducked out, distracted or
called by her co-worker to do something. Or perhaps she went to change into
the uniform. She said she will be right back. We waited in the staircase.
We knew where we had to go, but the doors forward and back were locked. And
standing there quietly, together, we learned something about the jail. It's
true despair lie not in round-the-clock surveillance. It was in the isolation
from the outside world. The despair came not from being watched, but from the
realization that we were not being watched enough. That there is no way to
connect to the outside. And that the system despite romantic imagination was
the opposite of a panoptic in some way. It operated by pen and paper. It was
not connected in the way we thought it would be. We signed in and out with
crooked squiggles. Our drive licences were exchanged for shabby pieces of
laminated paper. In short, noone really knew we were here.

In this lies the fundamental insight of Bernard's book. We are witnessing the
emergence of a fundamentally new kind of order. The congealing chrysalis of
this structure frustrates our intuitions about spectacle, surveillance, and
control. We live in an expository society, Bernard writes, in a society of
exposure and exhibition. In this perverse light, the inability to expose
oneself seems like punishment. And to be watched is a reward. Thus begins the
book: neither Deleuze nor Foucault nor Orwell. Expository power, he calls it.
No need for bars nor cells or watchtowers (this is on page 17, if you are
following along) we will enter into the machine willingly. We will demand
entrance. And we will show.

Short of reading out loud, I cannot do justice to the full complexity of the
book. Allow me instead to offer a few illustrations, as footnotes to proceed
directly to the challenge that this book presents to us, readers.

" Wi-Vi is a new technology
that enables seeing through walls using Wi-Fi signals. It allows us to track
moving humans through walls and behind closed doors. Wi-Vi relies on capturing
the reflections of its own transmitted signals off moving objects behind a
wall in order to track them. Wi-Vi's operation does not require access to any
device on the other side of the wall."  Fadel Adib      Dina Katabi  from Mit.

Just a few years ago, the suggestion that such devices would be in use for
surveillance, the strange collusion that Bernard describes between private and
public instruments of surveillance, a collusion that Bernard suggests
reconfigures the very notion of the modern state, that suggestion, shuffled
into a tin foil hat, would occupy the paranoid fringes of intellectual
conversation. Today, we do not even blink in response. The state of affairs
that Bernard carefully describes in the middle portions of the book builds an
overwhelming case for the contemporary condition of expository society.
