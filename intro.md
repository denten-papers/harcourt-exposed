Last summer I spent a few short hours at Riker's Island Correctional Facility
together with a small group of volunteers from Columbia University.  We were
there ostensibly to run an educational program. Wanting to move away from
traditional classroom arrangements, we conceived of our project, Rikers Bot,
as a digital storytelling event, combining elements of a programming workshop
and a writers group. The idea was to get folks excited about programming, to
give a measure of voice to those housed at Rikers under sometimes appalling
conditions, and to give the public at large a glimpse into an otherwise opaque
institution. Most importantly, we were there to spend a bit of time with the
young people of Rikers. It was an encounter with the penal system in the midst
of our community.

Even in the best of times, entering Rikers is not easy. One goes through a
series of gates and checkpoints. One laminated card is exchanged for another.
The guard stamps a mark on your wrist using invisible ink.

But the jail was also not what I expected. I thought that once inside, I would
observe the state of total surveillance. Conditioned by the Foucauldian image
of the panopticon I expected to see docile bodies, the control of activity,
hierarchical observation, the panopticon. Instead, we were all struck by the
dilapidated, almost abandoned feeling of the grounds. At one point, a young
guard, not in uniform yet, on the way to start her shift, ushered us in
quickly and probably without following protocol. She led us through rooms
filled with well-used riot gear, past guards eating breakfast, through
hallways lined with hand-written bills about job safety, potlucks, and charity
football games.

We were on the way to a wing of the building which housed the classrooms. But
at some point, while walking up a staircase, our guide ducked out into a side
door, which locked behind her. Perhaps she went to change into her uniform.
We waited in the staircase. We knew where we had to go, but the doors ahead of
us and behind were locked. Standing there quietly, together, we understood
something about the jail. Despite the guards and the cameras, it was not a
place of total surveillance. The building stood in isolation from the outside
world. Our presence here was registered by hand in a notebook. We traded our
state issued identification for a piece of paper and a stamp. We left no
digital trace. In short, no one really knew we were here.

A moment of silence in the stairwell punctuated the paradox at the center of
Bernard Harcourt's recent book, *Exposed: Desire and Disobedience in the
Digital Age*. Panopticons of incarceration from centuries past pail in
comparison with those that surround us today. Rather than acquiescing to
structures of command and surveillance by force, against our will, and in
confinement, we have surrendered to them voluntarily, without duress, and at
scale that reaches ubiquitously past prisons into open space. The condition of
willful exposure Harcourt describes in his book challenges well-worn tropes of
critical theory. Harcourt begins by noting that we inhabit nether Guy Dubord's
"society of spectacle" nor Michel Foucault's "punitive society." Rather, the
book documents the emergence of a "new architecture of power relations,"
"knots of state-like power," and "mini-theaters of consumption."

A new logic of watching and being watched brings with it novel companions: the
body double in the reflection of our devices, the quantified self, the ever
vigilant artificially intelligent personal assistant. Where some wear ankle
bracelet tracking devices in punishment, others strap on wrist bracelet
tracking devices in the name of health and self discovery. The momentary quiet
of a stairway somewhere at Rikers, stripped from the noise of cell phones and
Twitter feeds, gave me a visceral feeling of isolation. Rikers was scary not
because it represented order, but because compared to my usually
compartmentalized and hyper-connected life it gave room to violence and
disorder. "It sounds like I'm in a zoo with all of the birds chirping," wrote
one of the young people.  "Jail makes us feel deprived and cause
vagueness---lacking definite form or character," the bot tweeted. "All the
birds outside the windows make it so hard to hear anything."

The expository society, as Harcourt calls this emerging assemblage of
technology, practice, norms, and institutions, frustrates long-held intuitions
about spectacle and surveillance, inside and outside, public and private. We
live in an expository society, Bernard writes, in a society of willful
exposure and exhibition. In this perverse light, the inability to expose
oneself seems like punishment. And the reward for being watched---liked,
favorited, followed---is personal affirmation. Under the emerging regime there
is no need for bars, cells or watchtowers. We enter into the hall of mirrors
willingly. We demand entrance. And we reveal ourselves in return.

To make sense of the revealment, Harcourt suggests metaphors that open as yet
unexplored critical possibilities. The state is no longer one thing, but many.
It is an oligarchic "amalgam" of the intelligence community, retailers,
Silicon Valley, military and corporate interests, social media, politics,
banking, and telecommunication. No longer a big brother, it rather looks like
an octopus from the US National Reconnaissance Office, one of the country's
seventeen intelligence agencies. Instead of the panopticon we have a pavilion
of glass and mirrors. The pavilion does not just observe: it gives glimpses,
it reflects, distorts, and offers "pockets of obscurity." Like the ivory
tower, the panopticon represented power remote and centralized. The pavilion
is is close and distributed. It is a place to watch and be watched; to play
and to surveil. Instead of the uncanny body of the impostor double, Harcourt
gives us the diligent data double. The data double lives in the statistics of
criminal justice and advertisement. It dutifully embodies our social media
habits, our moods, movements, and our "click through" ratios.

We have only began to understand the personal and political implications of
the expository society in which surveillance is both more total and more
voluntary that was every imagined. The nightmare of Orwell's 1984 is in some
ways less intrusive than the reality of 2016. Harcourt book ultimately points
to the desire at the root of our need for exposure. Total surveillance turns
out to be pretty fun. You watch people do weird shit online! And share your
love for perfectly stacked pancakes with friends! These small bits of fun turn
out to be worth quite a bit. We are willing to trade a large measure of
privacy in the pursuit of watching and sharing. The desire at the center of
the voluntary exposure conundrum leads to a truly staggering insight.
Harcourt writes, and I am there with him, about the not-too distant
possibility of a future in which there will be no need to incarcerate. "We
will all be watched closely," he writes.  "We won't need to confine anyone,
because we will be able to see everywhere" and perhaps even "control behavior
from a distance."

The banal realities of today's surveillance technology far surpass the tin
foil conspiracies of yesterday. Consider the following several footnotes of my
own not found in the book. Even though I consider myself a lapsed software
engineer among humanists, I continue to regularly follow news and to review
literature from the tech world. Two devices have caught my attention in 2015.
The first is called OnHub made by Google. The marketing materials describe it
as a "new type of router for the new way to Wi-Fi." It is supposed to help you
stay connected to the internet at home. The device is remarkable for its
"innovative circular antenna design," which "provides reliable Wi-Fi coverage
in more directions in your home." A tear-down of OnHub by engineers at IFIXIT
revealed 13 antennas, along with an ambient light sensor inside.

The second is called Echo, by Amazon. This one is a bit trickier. It is
something like Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana, but in its own sleek
speaker cabinet, meant for the living room. It listens, plays music, and
answers questions. "Amazon Echo is designed around your voice," the marketing
materials read:

> It's hands-free and always on. Tucked under the light ring on Echo is an
> array of seven microphones. These sensors use beam-forming technology to
> hear you from any direction, even while music is playing. Echo is also an
> expertly tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound [...]
> Echoâ€”is built in the cloud, so it is always getting smarter. The more you
> use Echo, the more it adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and
> personal preferences."

Uncharacteristically for such gadgets both OnHub and Echo are meant to occupy
a central place in the home. Routers and speakers of this sort are usually
unsightly, rectangular affairs. We put them on top of shelves or under our
desks. The Echo and the OnHub router differ in that they are both sleek and
round. Both look like little watchtowers and both are jam-packed with sensors.
The advertisements show them placed on coffee tables and kitchen counters.

I submit two further pieces of evidence for your consideration. In 2014
researchers from UC Berkley published a paper titled "SoundLoc: Acoustic
Method for Indoor Localization without Infrastructure." The researchers write
that: "SoundLoc is a room-level localization system that exploits the
intrinsic acoustic properties of individual rooms and obviates the needs for
infrastructures." Using something called the "Room Impulse Response
measurement system" the researchers develop an algorithm that uses ordinary
microphones found on our laptops and cellphones essentially to create a "sound
fingerprint" for each room and to identify the location of its occupants.

In 2013, a group from MIT published a paper titled "See through walls with
WiFi!" "For many years humans have fantasized about X-ray vision," the authors
write. Could it be possible today, using Wi-Fi signals emitted by an ordinary
router? As it turns out, yes: "we present Wi-Vi, a wireless technology that
uses Wi-Fi signals to detect moving humans behind walls in closed rooms."

Just a few years ago, the very idea of mapping rooms with microphones or
tracking humans behind closed doors with Wi-Fi would be relegated to the realm
of an Ian Fleming novel. And the suggestion that that consumers would
voluntarily place devices capable of such extreme levels of surveillance still
seems unbelievable somehow, despite the evidence. The technology seems like
magic in some way. It simply cannot be. They wouldn't. And I have no evidence
that Amazon or Google intends to use their hubs and echoes for the purpose of
surveillance. The point is not to vilify technology. Given the chance to
better to see ourselves in the digital reflection, we will mount such mirrors
in our living rooms voluntarily. And we will pay for the privilege. The
balance between vanity and civic virtue will tilt towards vanity.

What is to be done? The weight of the book lies in the revealment of the
dynamics of desire that bring the expository society into existence. *Exposed*
ends with a call to action. If we are to be watched, we must also be able to
return the gaze. Forces of capital and control have to grow transparent in
proportion to our own transparency. Who will watch the watchers? Acts of
whistle-blowers like Chelsea Manning and publishers like Julian Assange
suggest a way forward. So do strategies of obfuscation as described in the
recent volume by Finn Brunton and Helen Nissenbaum. But can these isolated
strategies amount to a broader movement for digital resistance? The book ends
there, with a provocation to the reader. Because the erosion of privacy and
the rise of the expository society happens through countless small, personal
decisions, the answer must involve a collective response with the
participation of every digital subject.

I see at least three ways forward. Allow me to suggest them quickly.

\- The war. My family moved to this country in 1991, at the end of the Cold
War. Since then, the United States has found new enemies. And the country
entered a state of perpetual war. Much of what Bernard describes in his book,
is done in the name of extraordinary measures during wartime. Extraordinary
measures are a favorite tools of tyrannies. Yet the anti-war rhetoric that
defined generations of left-wing activists has receded into the background.
Violence is perhaps more palatable now because it is hidden and dehumanized.
The first way forward then is to renew our commitment to demilitarization.

\- Second, the dissolution of the Soviet Union heralded the decline of an
ideology: namely statist socialsm and centrally-planned economy. Yet, we have
yet to deal intellectually with the centralizing forces of capitalist
economies. Monopoly has long been a staple of neo-liberalism. Entities like
Google, Amazon, Uber, and AirBnB exert immense centralizing pressures on the
marketplace, including the marketplace of ideas. From the engineering systems
perspective, the alternative to such central structures is distribution. For
this reason we see the emergence of distributed technologies like Diaspora
(mentioned in the book), bit-torrent, bit-coin, Library Genesis, and
Wikipedia. These are marked by an attempt to decentralize infrastructure. In
parallel, we witness a resurgent interest in the earlier, abortive branch of
anti-statist communism. Figures like Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Bookchin figure
prominently in the conversation about technological resistance.

Finally, Bernard's book makes it impossible not feel complicit in the
system by which thousands of thousands of voluntary daily micro transactions,
which in aggregate bring the expository society into existence. As a community
that values intellectual independence, we must begin to align the sharp edge
of critical theory with our practice. This includes the way we read, write,
find, and share information online. For people who spend so much time in front
of our computers in search for knowledge, we are remarkable alienated from the
material contexts of knowledge production. *Exposed* reminds us of an
uncomfortable truth and I am excited to continue the conversation about
possible solutions.

remain
therefore keenly interested in the literal deconstruction of devices that
surround us. I want to get to know them, just as much as they want to get to
know me.
