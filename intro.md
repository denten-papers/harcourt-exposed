Last summer I spent a few short hours at Riker's Island Correctional Facility
together with a small group of volunteers from Columbia University.  We were
there ostensibly to run an educational program. Wanting to move away from
traditional classroom arrangements, we conceived of our project, Rikers Bot,
as a digital storytelling event, combining elements of a programming workshop
and a writers group. The idea was to get folks excited about programming, to
give a measure of voice to those housed at Rikers under sometimes appalling
conditions, and to give the public at large a glimpse into an otherwise opaque
institution. Most importantly, we were there to spend a bit of time with the
young people of Rikers. It was an encounter with the penal system in the midst
of our community.

Even in the best of times, entering Rikers is not easy. One goes through a
series of gates and checkpoints. One laminated card is exchanged for another.
The guard stamps a mark on your wrist using invisible ink.

The jail was also not what I expected. I thought that once inside, I would
observe a state of total surveillance. Conditioned by the Foucauldian image of
the panopticon, I expected to see docile bodies, the control of activity, and
the swarming of disciplinary mechanisms. Instead, many in the group were
struck by the dilapidated, almost abandoned feeling of the grounds. At one
point, something was the matter at the main gate and we were ushered through
an alternative entrance. A guard led us through rooms filled with well-used
riot gear, past other guards eating breakfast, and through hallways lined with
hand-written bills about job safety, potlucks, and charity football games.

We were on the way to a wing of the building which housed the classrooms. But
at some point, while walking up the stairs, our guide ducked out into a side
door, which locked behind her. We waited in the stairwell. We knew where we
had to go, but the doors ahead of us and behind were locked. Standing there
quietly, together, we understood something about the jail. Despite the guards
and the cameras, it was not a place of total surveillance. The building stood
in isolation from the outside world. Our presence here was registered in a
notebook by hand. We traded our state issued identification for a piece of
paper and a stamp. We left no digital trace. In short, no one really knew we
were here.

A moment of silence on the stairs punctuated the paradox at the center of
Bernard Harcourt's recent book, *Exposed: Desire and Disobedience in the
Digital Age*. Real and imaginary panopticons of incarceration from centuries
past pale in comparison with those that surround us today. Rather than
acquiescing to structures of command and surveillance by force, against our
will, and in confinement, we have surrendered to them voluntarily, without
duress, and at scale that reaches ubiquitously past prisons into open space.
The condition of willful exposure Harcourt describes in his book challenges
well-worn tropes of critical theory. Harcourt begins by noting that we inhabit
neither Guy Dubord's "society of spectacle" nor Michel Foucault's "punitive
society." Rather, the book documents the emergence of a "new architecture of
power relations," "knots of state-like power," and "mini-theaters of
consumption."

A new logic of watching and being watched brings with it novel companions: the
body double in the reflection of our devices, the quantified self, the ever
vigilant artificially intelligent personal assistant. Where some wear tracking
ankle bracelets in punishment, others strap on tracking wrist bracelets in the
name of health and self discovery. Absent the noise of cell phones and Twitter
feeds, the momentary quiet of a stairwell somewhere at Rikers evoked a
visceral feeling of isolation. Rikers was scary not because it represented
order but because compared to my usually compartmentalized and hyper-connected
life it gave space to violence and disorder. "It sounds like I'm in a zoo with
all of the birds chirping," wrote one of the young people.  "Jail makes us
feel deprived and cause vagueness---lacking definite form or character," the
bot tweeted. "All the birds outside the windows make it so hard to hear
anything."

The expository society, as Harcourt calls this emerging assemblage of
technology, practice, norms, and institutions, frustrates long-held intuitions
about spectacle and surveillance, inside and outside, public and private. We
live in an expository society, Bernard writes, in a society of willful
exposure and exhibition. In this perverse light, the inability to expose
oneself seems like punishment. And the reward for being watched---liked,
favorited, followed---is personal affirmation. Under the emerging regime there
is no need for metal bars, cells, or watchtowers. We enter into the hall of
mirrors willingly. We demand entrance. And we expose ourselves in return.

To make sense of exposure, Harcourt suggests metaphors that open as yet
unexplored critical possibilities. The state is no longer one thing, but many.
It is an oligarchic amalgam comprised of the intelligence community,
retailers, Silicon Valley, military and corporate interests, social media,
politics, banking, and telecommunication. No longer a big brother, it looks
rather like an octopus from the badge of the US National Reconnaissance
Office, one of the country's seventeen intelligence agencies. Instead of the
panopticon we have a pavilion of glass and mirrors. More than an observation
tower, the pavilion offers glimpses: it reflects, distorts, and provides for
"pockets of obscurity." Like the ivory tower, the panopticons of the past used
to represent remote power. The metaphorical pavilion is close at hand. It is a
place to watch and be watched; to play and to surveil. Instead of the uncanny
body of the impostor double, Harcourt gives us the diligent data double. The
data double lives in the spreadsheets of criminal justice statistics and
advertising data used to train algorithms. It dutifully embodies our social
media habits, our moods, movements, and our "click through" ratios.

We have only begun to understand the personal and political implications of
the expository society in which surveillance is both more total and more
voluntary than was ever imagined. The nightmare of George Orwell's *1984* is
in some ways less intrusive than the reality of 2016. Harcourt's book
ultimately points to the desire at the root of our need for exposure. Total
surveillance turns out to be pretty enjoyable: Watch people do weird shit
online! Share your love for perfectly stacked pancakes with friends! We trade
privacy in return for these small bits of fun. Harcourt's work points to the
dynamics desire hat lead to voluntary exposure. It is a staggering insight:
soon, there will be no need to incarcerate. "We will all be watched closely,"
he writes. "We won't need to confine anyone, because we will be able to see
everywhere" and perhaps even "control behavior from a distance."

The banal realities of today's surveillance surpass even the tin foil
conspiracies of yesterday. Consider the following several footnotes of my own,
not found in Harcourt's book. A lapsed software engineer among humanists, I
continue to regularly follow news and to review literature from the tech
world. Two devices that help illustrate Harcourt's argument have caught my
attention in 2015. The first is called OnHub made by Google. The marketing
materials describe it as a "new type of router for the new way to Wi-Fi." It
is supposed to help you stay connected to the internet at home. The device is
remarkable for its "innovative circular antenna design," which "provides
reliable Wi-Fi coverage in more directions in your home." A tear-down of OnHub
by engineers at IFIXIT revealed 13 antennas, along with an ambient light
sensor inside.

The second is called Echo, by Amazon. This one is a bit trickier. It is an
artificially intelligent personal assistant, similar to Apple's Siri or
Microsoft's Cortana, but housed in its own sleek speaker cabinet, meant for
the living room. It listens, plays music, and answers questions. "Amazon Echo
is designed around your voice," the marketing materials read:

> It's hands-free and always on. Tucked under the light ring on Echo is an
> array of seven microphones. These sensors use beam-forming technology to
> hear you from any direction, even while music is playing. Echo is also an
> expertly tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound [...]
> Echoâ€”is built in the cloud, so it is always getting smarter. The more you
> use Echo, the more it adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and
> personal preferences.

Uncharacteristically for such gadgets, both OnHub and Echo occupy a central
place in the home. Routers and speakers of this sort are usually unsightly,
rectangular affairs. They are commonly hidden out of sight, under desks or on
top of shelves. The Echo speaker and the OnHub router differ in that they cut
an attractive tower-like figure. Both are packed with sensors. The
advertisements show them placed on coffee tables and kitchen counters.

I submit two further pieces of evidence for your consideration. Two recent
papers in computer science give us an idea of the potential for surveillance
enabled by the above devices. In 2014, researchers from UC Berkley published a
paper titled "SoundLoc: Acoustic Method for Indoor Localization without
Infrastructure." The researchers write that: "SoundLoc is a room-level
localization system that exploits the intrinsic acoustic properties of
individual rooms and obviates the needs for infrastructures." Calling it the
"Room Impulse Response measurement system," the researchers develop an
algorithm that uses ordinary microphones found on our laptops and cellphones
to create a "sound fingerprint" for each room and to identify the location of
its occupants. One would surmise that the seven microphones and the powerful
speakers that the Echo carries would make the device particularly well suited
for such echolocation, tracking, and fingerprinting of domestic spaces.

In 2013, a group from MIT published a similar paper titled "See through walls
with WiFi!" "For many years humans have fantasized about X-ray vision," the
authors write. Could it be possible today, using Wi-Fi signals emitted by an
ordinary router? As it turns out, yes: "We present Wi-Vi, a wireless
technology that uses Wi-Fi signals to detect moving humans behind walls in
closed rooms." Just a few years ago, the very idea of mapping rooms with
microphones or tracking humans behind closed doors with wireless signals would
be relegated to the pages of novel by Ian Fleming. The suggestion
that consumers would voluntarily place such capable devices in the middle of
their living rooms defies belief still, despite the evidence. Where a bug in a
hotel room caused scandals in the Nixon era, inviting a beastie that carries
13 antennas to the bedroom seems fine. Customers will pay $170 for the
privilege. The fact that the Samsung Smart TV, America's best selling
television set, is routinely recording conversations, even when powered off
barely made the news. The terms and conditions policy that comes with the
device simply states: "Please be aware that if your spoken words include
personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the
data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice
Recognition."

*Exposed* sounds a timely alarm about the proliferation of such seemingly
banal but powerful surveillance mechanisms. If we are to be watched, we must
also be able to return the gaze.  Forces of capital and control have to grow
transparent in proportion to our own transparency. Who will watch the
watchers? Acts of whistle-blowers like Chelsea Manning and publishers like
Julian Assange suggest a way forward. So do strategies of obfuscation
described in the recent volume by Finn Brunton and Helen Nissenbaum. But can
these isolated strategies amount to a broader movement for digital resistance?
Because the erosion of privacy and the rise of the expository society happens
through countless small, personal decisions, the answer must involve a
collective response with the participation of every digital subject. The book
ends there, calling the reader to action.

What is to be done? Compelled by Harcourt's call to action I suggest the
following several avenues for exploration in search for viable models for
digital dissent.

First, the war. We must not forget that the state of affairs Harcourt
describes in his book is linked intimately with the armaments of perpetual
warfare. The expository society is born not out of technological contingencies
alone, but also out of the extraordinary measures evoked during wartime.  The
passage of the USA Patriot act in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the Snowden
revelations, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act tucked into the
spending bill passed by the Congress at the end of 2015---these are all
connected events the lead to the same source, war. The ill-conceived barter at
the heart of all extraordinary measures would trade ideals central to
democratic governance for security. War forces our hand. We are told that if
we do not comply we would be vulnerable to another terrorist attack. History
tells us of a graver danger: tyranny, brought on by rushed measures during
seemingly exceptional times. We do not live under a tyrannical regime today.
But Harcourt's book does identify infrastructures that have the potential to
invite tyranny.

In light of this danger, no less real or pressing than terrorism, I am puzzled
by the decline of the anti-war movement. Anti-war rhetoric that defined a
generation of conscientious dissenters is no longer a major motivating force
for the politically active. According to a recent Gallup poll Americans worry
most about issues like immigration, terrorism, income inequality, drug use,
the size and power of federal government, the economy, and climate change. But
not war. Violence is perhaps more palatable now because it is hidden and
dehumanized by the use of technologies like night vision, "precision" strikes,
and remote drone warfare. But is it possible to restore, in Harcourt's words,
"lines between governance, commerce, surveillance, and private life" at home
without addressing militarization abroad? I do not think so. Everything near
will be exposed in the process of reaching for that hidden and remote threat
of terrorism. The perceived difficulty of blowing up an Afghani family on the
"deposition matrix," the US kill list, is used to justify the ease of domestic
surveillance. The expository reach reveals all, from here to there. Failing to
cease the continual projection of violence abroad, we will be forever unable
to stop the erosion of civic society at home.

Second, the economy. The dissolution of the Soviet Union heralded the decline
of an ideology: namely statist socialism and central planning. We have yet to
deal intellectually with the centralizing forces of capitalist economies.
Entities like Google, Amazon, Uber, and AirBnB exert immense centralizing
pressures on the marketplace, including the marketplace of ideas.  The
technologies Harcourt outlines in his book are all in some way related to the
massive aggregation of data. They are both the cause and effect of economies
in the process of centralization. Again I ask: Is it possible to address
massive surveillance programs without dealing with the underlying monopolies
in the marketplace of information? From the engineering systems perspective,
the alternative to such central structures is distribution. The emergence of
distributed technologies is marked by an attempt to decentralize
infrastructure. Witness Diaspora, a federated alternative to Facebook; bit
torrent, a system for decentralized file sharing; bitcoin, peer to peer money;
Library Genesis, community book collection and sharing; and Wikipedia, a
peer-produced Internet encyclopedia. The architecture of decentralized
communities follows a resurgent interest in the earlier, hitherto abortive
branch of anti-statist socialism. Thinkers like Mikhail Bakunin, Peter
Kropotkin, and Murray Bookchin are making a comeback, figuring prominently in
the conversation about technological resistance. A wider return to this
intellectual tradition could fill the critical void left in liberal thought by
the decline of communism.

Finally, Harcourt's book makes it impossible not to feel personally complicit
in the system by which countless small voluntary transactions, in aggregate,
bring the expository society into existence. "Our desires and our passions
have enslaved us," Harcourt writes. The emotional affirmation that accompanies
exuberant social networking brings with it the very structures of surveillance
and control that are used widely by law enforcement and national security
agencies. As a community of readers and writers that value intellectual
independence, we must begin to align the sharp edge of critical theory with
everyday practice. This includes the way we read, write, find, and share
information online. For people who spend so much time in front of our
computers in search for knowledge, we are remarkably alienated from the
material contexts of knowledge production. *Exposed* reminds us of an
uncomfortable truth at work in everyday human--computer interaction. We know
so little about the smart machines that observe us in our kitchens, offices,
and living rooms. Let us cultivate then a keen interest in their literal
deconstruction, to learn how they are made and where their wires lead.  To
strip the aura of fetishism that attaches itself to such magical devices we
need to develop a healthy level of detachment from dumb and inanimate things.

Judging by consumer behavior, the machines that expose us are for the moment
worth the asking price. They offer enough of a value to overcome the ethical
imperative. I have no evidence that Amazon or Google intends to use their hubs
and echoes for the purpose of surveillance.  There is no need to search for it
either, because it is laid out openly, in the terms of service. We are far
past the point of caring about the number of cameras or microphones already in
action. The idea is not to vilify technology. Harcourt does a masterful job
identifying desire as the engine that powers the voluntary surveillance
conundrum. Given the chance to better see ourselves in the digital reflection,
we will willingly mount many mirrors. The balance between vanity and civic
virtue tilts inevitably towards vanity. The burden of ethical reasoning lies
ultimately on the part of an informed public. But for now, being informed is
still less fun than watching a smart TV. Consequently, dissent remains the
purview of a select few, until the pain of tyranny overwhelms the pleasure of
mass exposure.
