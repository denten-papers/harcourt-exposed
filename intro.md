Allow me to start with a story. During this summer I had the chance to spend a
few short hours at Riker's Island Correctional Facility together with a select
group of students and collogues, which on at least one occasion included
Bernard's partner, Mia. We were there ostensibly for an educational program.
Our project, Rikers Bot, combined a programming workshop and a storytelling
group. More importantly, we were there to spend a bit of time with the young
people of Rikers. It was an encounter with the penal system in the midst of
our community.

Even in the best of times, entering Rikers is not easy. One goes through a
series of gates and checkpoints. One laminated card is exchanged for another.
The guard stamps a mark on your wrist using invisible ink.

But the jail was also not what I expected from the Foucauldian image of the
panopticon. I thought that once inside, I would observe the state of total
surveillance. Instead, we were all struck by the dilapidated, almost abandoned
feeling of the facility grounds. At one point, a young guard, not in uniform
yet, on the way to start her shift, ushered us in quickly and probably against
protocol. She led us through rooms filled with well-used riot gear, past
guards eating breakfast, through hallways lined with posters about job safety,
potlucks, charity football games.

We were on the way to a wing of the building which housed classrooms. But at
some point, while walking up a staircase, our guide ducked out into a side
door, which locked behind her. Perhaps she went to change into her uniform.
We waited in the staircase. We knew where we had to go, but the doors ahead of
us and behind were locked. Standing there quietly, together, we understood
something about the jail. Despite the guards and cameras, it was not a place
of total surveillance. The building stood in isolation from the outside world.
Our presence here was registered by hand in a notebook. We traded our state
issued identification for a piece of paper and a stamp. We left no digital
trace. In short, no one really knew we were here.

In this lies the fundamental insight of Bernard's book. *Exposed* documents
the emergence of a fundamentally different kind of order. The congealing
chrysalis of this emerging structure frustrates long-held intuitions about
spectacle and surveillance, inside and outside, public and private. We live in
an expository society, Bernard writes, in a society of willful exposure and
exhibition. In this perverse light, the inability to expose oneself seems like
punishment. And the reward for being watched--liked, favorited, followed--is
personal affirmation. Thus begins the book: neither Deleuze nor Foucault nor
Orwell capture the dynamics of expository power, as Bernard calls it. There is
need for bars nor cells or watchtowers (this is on page 17, if you are
following along) we enter into the hall of mirrors willingly. We will demand
entrance.  And we reveal ourselves in return.

I cannot do justice to the full weight of evidence carefully presented in this
volume (short of reading the book out loud as my colleague Manan Ahmed
suggested). Allow me instead to offer a few technical-theoretical
illustrations as side-notes and commentary on the middle chapters. And then
let's proceed to the conclusion, which demands our attention.

I submit two devices for your consideration. Both came on the market this
year. And both were introduced by some of the largest private entities
implicated in Bernard's story: Google and Amazon.[^ln-samsung]

\- Google OnHub, "A new type of router for the new way to Wi-Fi," Remarkable
for its "innovative circular antenna design," which "provides reliable Wi-Fi
coverage in more directions in your home." A tear-down of the device by
engineers at IFIXIT revealed 13 antennas, along with an ambient light sensor
inside.

\- Amazon Echo. "Amazon Echo is designed around your voice. It's hands-free
and always on. Tucked under the light ring on Echo is an array of seven
microphones. These sensors use beam-forming technology to hear you from any
direction, even while music is playing. Echo is also an expertly tuned speaker
that can fill any room with immersive sound." "Echoâ€”is built in the cloud,"
the materials go on to say, "so it is always getting smarter. The more you use
Echo, the more it adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal
preferences."

What is interesting to me about these gadgets is the central place they are
meant to occupy in the home. The router and the speaker were always ugly and
hidden devices. We put them on top of shelves or under our desks. The Echo and
the OnHub router differ from similar devices in that they are both round: they
are towers. Both companies encourage customers to place them centrally in the
home.

I submit two further pieces of evidence for your consideration.

\- In 2014 researchers from UC Berkley published a paper. "SoundLoc is a
room-level localization system that exploits the intrinsic acoustic properties
of individual rooms and obviates the needs for infrastructures. The main
contributions of our work are the following. First, a cost-effective RIR (Room
Impulse Response) measurement system is implemented and the Noise Adaptive
Extraction of Reverberation (NAER) algorithm is developed to estimate room
acoustic parameters in noisy conditions. Second, a comprehensive physical and
statistical analysis of features extracted from RIRs is performed. Also,
SoundLoc is evaluated using the dataset consisting of ten (10) different
rooms. The overall accuracy of 97.8% achieved demonstrates the potential to be
integrated into automatic mapping of building space."

\- In a paper published in the Association for Computing Machinery's Special
Interest Group on Data Communications 2013 proceedings, Fadel Adib and Dina
Katabi from MIT introduce something they call Wi-Vi. "Wi-Vi is a new
technology that enables seeing through walls using Wi-Fi signals. It allows us
to track moving humans through walls and behind closed doors. Wi-Vi relies on
capturing the reflections of its own transmitted signals off moving objects
behind a wall in order to track them. Wi-Vi's operation does not require
access to any device on the other side of the wall."

Just a few years ago, the suggestion that such devices would be in use for
surveillance, in the strange collusion between public and private instruments
and bureaucracies of exposition, would be relegated to the paranoid fringe of
the critical conversation. Today, the evidence is impossible to dismiss. The
state of affairs that Bernard carefully describes in the middle portions of
the book builds an overwhelming case for the emergence of the expository
society, which reconfigures the very notions of self and state.

I have no evidence that the purpose of these new breed of gadgets, meant to
occupy a central space in our living rooms, is indeed to map out our homes or
or to trace our conversations. I want to merely note that it is technically
and legally possible. I therefore remain keenly interested in the literal
deconstruction of such devices. I want to get to know them, just as much as
they want to get to know me. Bernard's books gives us a language to unfold
something like the tehchno-semiotics of expository power. (I mean the thing is
not subtle, it is called Echo). Bernard encourages us to turn the camera
around and to return the gaze, making transparent the room on the other side
of the one-way mirror.

These small remark bring us to the conclusion of the volume. Dissent Bernard
suggests is possible, but how? There are some ideas in the occluding chapters,
but I think the book is meant as a provocation to our community. The book asks us to rise to
the challenge of technology.

I see at least three ways forward. Allow me to suggest them quickly.

\- The war. My family moved to this country in 1991, at the end of the Cold
War. Since then, the United States has found new enemies. And the country
entered a state of perpetual war. Much of what Bernard describes in his book,
is done in the name of extraordinary measures during wartime. Extraordinary
measures are a favorite tools of tyrannies. Yet the anti-war rhetoric that
defined generations of left-wing activists has receded into the background.
Violence is perhaps more palatable now because it is hidden and dehumanized.
The first way forward then is to renew our commitment to demilitarization.

\- Second, the dissolution of the Soviet Union heralded the decline of an
ideology: namely statist socialsm and centrally-planned economy. Yet, we have
yet to deal intellectually with the centralizing forces of capitalist
economies. Monopoly has long been a staple of neo-liberalism. Entities like
Google, Amazon, Uber, and AirBnB exert immense centralizing pressures on the
marketplace, including the marketplace of ideas. From the engineering systems
perspective, the alternative to such central structures is distribution. For
this reason we see the emergence of distributed technologies like Diaspora
(mentioned in the book), bit-torrent, bit-coin, Library Genesis, and
Wikipedia. These are marked by an attempt to decentralize infrastructure. In
parallel, we witness a resurgent interest in the earlier, abortive branch of
anti-statist communism. Figures like Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Bookchin figure
prominently in the conversation about technological resistance.

\- Finally, Bernard's book makes it impossible not feel complicit in the
system by which thousands of thousands of voluntary daily micro transactions,
which in aggregate bring the expository society into existence. As a community
that values intellectual independence, we must begin to align the sharp edge
of critical theory with our practice. This includes the way we read, write,
find, and share information online. For people who spend so much time in front
of our computers in search for knowledge, we are remarkable alienated from the
material contexts of knowledge production. *Exposed* reminds us of an
uncomfortable truth and I am excited to continue the conversation about
possible solutions.
