Allow me to start with a story. During this summer I had the chance to spend a
few short hours at Riker's Island Correctional Facility together with a select
group of students and collogues, which on at least one occasion included
Bernard's partner, Mia. We were there ostensibly for an educational program.
Our project, Rikers Bot, combined a programming workshop and a storytelling
group. More importantly, we were there to spend a bit of time with the young
people of Rikers. It was an encounter with the penal system in the midst of
our community.

Even in the best of times, entering Rikers is not easy. One goes through a
series of gates and checkpoints. One laminated card is exchanged for another.
The guard stamps a mark on your wrist using invisible ink.

But the jail was also not what I expected from the Foucauldian image of the
panopticon. I thought that once inside, I would observe the state of total
surveillance. Instead, we were all struck by the dilapidated, almost abandoned
feeling of the facility grounds. At one point, a young guard, not in uniform
yet, on the way to start her shift, ushered us in quickly and probably against
protocol. She led us through rooms filled with well-used riot gear, past
guards eating breakfast, through hallways lined with posters about job safety,
potlucks, charity football games.

We were on the way to a wing of the building which housed classrooms. But at
some point, while walking up a staircase, our guide ducked out into a side
door, which locked behind her. Perhaps she went to change into her uniform.
We waited in the staircase. We knew where we had to go, but the doors ahead of
us and behind were locked. Standing there quietly, together, we understood
something about the jail. Despite the guards and cameras, it was not a place
of total surveillance. The building stood in isolation from the outside world.
Our presence here was registered by hand in a notebook. We traded our state
issued identification for a piece of paper. We left no digital traces. In
short, no one really knew we were here.

In this lies the fundamental insight of Bernard's book. *Exposed* documents
the emergence of a fundamentally different kind of order. The congealing
chrysalis of this emerging structure frustrates long-held intuitions about
spectacle and surveillance, inside and outside, public and private. We live in
an expository society, Bernard writes, in a society of exposure and
exhibition. In this perverse light, the inability to expose oneself seems like
punishment. And to be watched--liked, favorited, followed--is to be rewarded
and to be affirmed. Thus begins the book: neither Deleuze nor Foucault nor
Orwell. Expository power, Bernard calls it. No need for bars nor cells or
watchtowers (this is on page 17, if you are following along) we enter into the
hall of mirrors willingly. We will demand entrance. And we reveal ourselves in
return.

I cannot do justice to the full weight of evidence carefully presented in this
volume (short of reading the book out loud as my colleague Manan Ahmed
suggested). Allow me instead to offer a few technical-theoretical
illustrations as footnotes and commentary on the middle chapters. And then
let's proceed to the conclusion, which demands our attention.

I submit two devices for your consideration. Both came on the market this
year. And both were introduced by some of the largest private entities
implicated in Bernard's story: Samsung, Google, and Amazon.

1. Samsung Smart TV, the world's largest manufacturer of televisions. "Please
be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive
information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted
to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition," Samsung said in its
terms and conditions policy."

2. Google OnHub, "A new type of router for the new way to Wi-Fi," Remarkable
for its "innovative circular antenna design," which "provides reliable Wi-Fi
coverage in more directions in your home." A tear-down of the device by
engineers at IFIXIT revealed 13 antennas, along with an ambient light sensor.

3. Amazon Echo. "Amazon Echo is designed around your voice. It's hands-free
and always on. Tucked under the light ring on Echo is an array of seven
microphones. These sensors use beam-forming technology to hear you from any
direction, even while music is playing. Echo is also an expertly tuned speaker
that can fill any room with immersive sound." "Echoâ€”is built in the cloud,"
the materials go on to say, "so it is always getting smarter. The more you use
Echo, the more it adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal
preferences."

What is interesting to me about these gadgets is the central place they
occupy in the home. The television I understand: it has been the focal point
of the American living room for decades. But the router and the speaker are
usually ugly and hidden devices. We put them on top of shelves or under our
desks. The Echo and the OnHub, differ from similar devices in that they are
both round. Both companies encourage customers to place them centrally in the
home.

I submit two further pieces of evidence for your consideration.

1. In 2013 researchers from UC Berkley published a paper. "SoundLoc is a
room-level localization system that exploits the intrinsic acoustic properties
of individual rooms and obviates the needs for infrastructures. The main
contributions of our work are the following. First, a cost-effective RIR (Room
Impulse Response) measurement system is implemented and the Noise Adaptive
Extraction of Reverberation (NAER) algorithm is developed to estimate room
acoustic parameters in noisy conditions. Second, a comprehensive physical and
statistical analysis of features extracted from RIRs is performed. Also,
SoundLoc is evaluated using the dataset consisting of ten (10) different
rooms. The overall accuracy of 97.8% achieved demonstrates the potential to be
integrated into automatic mapping of building space."

2. In a paper published in the Association for Computing Machinery's Special
Interest Group on Data Communications 2013 proceedings, Fadel Adib and Dina
Katabi from MIT introduce something they call Wi-Vi. "Wi-Vi is a new
technology that enables seeing through walls using Wi-Fi signals. It allows us
to track moving humans through walls and behind closed doors. Wi-Vi relies on
capturing the reflections of its own transmitted signals off moving objects
behind a wall in order to track them. Wi-Vi's operation does not require
access to any device on the other side of the wall."

Just a few years ago, the suggestion that such devices would be in use for
surveillance, in the strange collusion that Bernard describes between private
and public instruments of surveillance, the collusion that Bernard suggests
reconfigures the very notion of the modern state, that suggestion, shuffled
into a tin foil hat, would occupy the paranoid fringes of intellectual
conversation. Today, we do not even blink in response. The state of affairs
that Bernard carefully describes in the middle portions of the book builds an
overwhelming case for the contemporary condition of expository society.

These devices are new. I have no evidence that their purpose is indeed to map
our homes or to listen to our conversations. But I am keenly interested in the
literal deconstruction of such devices. I want to get to know them, just as
much as they want to get to know me. Bernard's books gives us a language to
unfold something like the tehchno-semiotics of expository power. I mean the
thing is called echo. To turn the camera around, as he writes. And to look
back beyond the reflecting surface of a one way mirror.

Three ways forward.

1. Ending . Extraordinary measures.

2. Decentralization. Reviving.

3. Alienation from the material contexts of knowledge production. Thousands of
voluntary daily micro transactions, which in aggregate bring the expository
society into existence. As a community that values intellectual independence,
we must begin to align the sharp edge of critical theory with our practice.
This includes the way we read, write, find, and share information online.
