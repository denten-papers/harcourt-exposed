Last summer I spent a few short hours at Riker's Island Correctional Facility
together with a small group of volunteers from Columbia University.  We were
there ostensibly to run an educational program. Wanting to move away from
traditional classroom arrangements, we conceived of our project, Rikers Bot,
as a digital storytelling event, combining elements of a programming workshop
and a writers group. The idea was to get folks excited about programming, to
give a measure of voice to those housed at Rikers under sometimes appalling
conditions, and to give the public at large a glimpse into an otherwise opaque
institution. Most importantly, we were there to spend a bit of time with the
young people of Rikers. It was an encounter with the penal system in the midst
of our community.

Even in the best of times, entering Rikers is not easy. One goes through a
series of gates and checkpoints. One laminated card is exchanged for another.
The guard stamps a mark on your wrist using invisible ink.

The jail was also not what I expected. I thought that once inside, I would
observe the state of total surveillance. Conditioned by the Foucauldian image
of the panopticon I expected to see docile bodies, the control of activity,
hierarchical observation, the panopticon. Instead, many in the group were
struck by the dilapidated, almost abandoned feeling of the grounds. At one
point, a young guard, not in uniform yet, on the way to start her shift,
ushered us in quickly and probably without following protocol. She led us
through rooms filled with well-used riot gear, past guards eating breakfast,
and through hallways lined with hand-written bills about job safety, potlucks,
and charity football games.

We were on the way to a wing of the building which housed the classrooms. But
at some point, while walking up a staircase, our guide ducked out into a side
door, which locked behind her. Perhaps she went to change into her uniform.
We waited in the staircase. We knew where we had to go, but the doors ahead of
us and behind were locked. Standing there quietly, together, we understood
something about the jail. Despite the guards and the cameras, it was not a
place of total surveillance. The building stood in isolation from the outside
world. Our presence here was registered by hand in a notebook. We traded our
state issued identification for a piece of paper and a stamp. We left no
digital trace. In short, no one really knew we were here.

A moment of silence in the stairwell punctuated the paradox at the center of
Bernard Harcourt's recent book, *Exposed: Desire and Disobedience in the
Digital Age*. Real and imaginary panopticons of incarceration from centuries
past pail in comparison with those that surround us today. Rather than
acquiescing to structures of command and surveillance by force, against our
will, and in confinement, we have surrendered to them voluntarily, without
duress, and at scale that reaches ubiquitously past prisons into open space.
The condition of willful exposure Harcourt describes in his book challenges
well-worn tropes of critical theory. Harcourt begins by noting that we inhabit
nether Guy Dubord's "society of spectacle" nor Michel Foucault's "punitive
society." Rather, the book documents the emergence of a "new architecture of
power relations," "knots of state-like power," and "mini-theaters of
consumption."

A new logic of watching and being watched brings with it novel companions: the
body double in the reflection of our devices, the quantified self, the ever
vigilant artificially intelligent personal assistant. Where some wear ankle
bracelet tracking devices in punishment, others strap on wrist bracelet
tracking devices in the name of health and self discovery. Absent the noise of
cell phones and Twitter feeds, the momentary quiet of a stairway somewhere at
Rikers evoked a visceral feeling of isolation. Rikers was scary not because it
represented order, but because compared to my usually compartmentalized and
hyper-connected life it gave room to violence and disorder. "It sounds like
I'm in a zoo with all of the birds chirping," wrote one of the young people.
"Jail makes us feel deprived and cause vagueness---lacking definite form or
character," the bot tweeted. "All the birds outside the windows make it so
hard to hear anything."

The expository society, as Harcourt calls this emerging assemblage of
technology, practice, norms, and institutions, frustrates long-held intuitions
about spectacle and surveillance, inside and outside, public and private. We
live in an expository society, Bernard writes, in a society of willful
exposure and exhibition. In this perverse light, the inability to expose
oneself seems like punishment. And the reward for being watched---liked,
favorited, followed---is personal affirmation. Under the emerging regime there
is no need for bars, cells or watchtowers. We enter into the hall of mirrors
willingly. We demand entrance. And we expose ourselves in return.

To make sense of the exposure, Harcourt suggests metaphors that open as yet
unexplored critical possibilities. The state is no longer one thing, but many.
It is an oligarchic amalgam comprised of the intelligence community,
retailers, Silicon Valley, military and corporate interests, social media,
politics, banking, and telecommunication. No longer a big brother, it looks
rather like an octopus from the badge of the US National Reconnaissance
Office, one of the country's seventeen intelligence agencies. Instead of the
panopticon we have a pavilion of glass and mirrors. More than an observation
tower, the pavilion offers glimpses, it reflects, distorts, and provides for
"pockets of obscurity." Like the ivory tower, the panopticon represented power
remote and centralized. The metaphorical pavilion is close at hand. It is a
place to watch and be watched; to play and to surveil. Instead of the uncanny
body of the impostor double, Harcourt gives us the diligent data double. The
data double lives in the spreadsheets of criminal justice statistics and
advertising data used to train algorithms. It dutifully embodies our social
media habits, our moods, movements, and our "click through" ratios.

We have only began to understand the personal and political implications of
the expository society in which surveillance is both more total and more
voluntary that was ever imagined. The nightmare of George Orwell's *1984* is
in some ways less intrusive than the reality of 2016. Harcourt book ultimately
points to the desire at the root of our need for exposure. Total surveillance
turns out to be pretty enjoyable: Watch people do weird shit online! Share
your love for perfectly stacked pancakes with friends! We trade privacy in
return for these small bits of fun. Harcourt's work points to the desire at
the center of the voluntary exposure conundrum. It is a staggering insight:
soon, there will be no need to incarcerate. "We will all be watched closely,"
he writes. "We won't need to confine anyone, because we will be able to see
everywhere" and perhaps even "control behavior from a distance."

The banal realities of today's surveillance technology surpass the tin foil
conspiracies of yesterday. Consider the following several footnotes of my own,
not found in the book. A lapsed software engineer among humanists, I continue
to regularly follow news and to review literature from the tech world. Two
devices have caught my attention in 2015. The first is called OnHub made by
Google. The marketing materials describe it as a "new type of router for the
new way to Wi-Fi." It is supposed to help you stay connected to the internet
at home. The device is remarkable for its "innovative circular antenna
design," which "provides reliable Wi-Fi coverage in more directions in your
home." A tear-down of OnHub by engineers at IFIXIT revealed 13 antennas, along
with an ambient light sensor inside.

The second is called Echo, by Amazon. This one is a bit trickier. It is
something like Apple's Siri or Microsoft's Cortana, but in its own sleek
speaker cabinet, meant for the living room. It listens, plays music, and
answers questions. "Amazon Echo is designed around your voice," the marketing
materials read:

> It's hands-free and always on. Tucked under the light ring on Echo is an
> array of seven microphones. These sensors use beam-forming technology to
> hear you from any direction, even while music is playing. Echo is also an
> expertly tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound [...]
> Echoâ€”is built in the cloud, so it is always getting smarter. The more you
> use Echo, the more it adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and
> personal preferences."

Uncharacteristically for such gadgets, both OnHub and Echo are meant to occupy
a central place in the home. Routers and speakers of this sort are usually
unsightly, rectangular affairs. They are commonly hidden out of sight, under
desks or on top of shelves. The Echo and the OnHub router differ in that they
but cut an attractive tower-like figure. Both are packed with sensors. The
advertisements show them placed on coffee tables and kitchen counters.

I submit two further pieces of evidence for your consideration. In 2014
researchers from UC Berkley published a paper titled "SoundLoc: Acoustic
Method for Indoor Localization without Infrastructure." The researchers write
that: "SoundLoc is a room-level localization system that exploits the
intrinsic acoustic properties of individual rooms and obviates the needs for
infrastructures." Using something called the "Room Impulse Response
measurement system" the researchers develop an algorithm that uses ordinary
microphones found on our laptops and cellphones to create a "sound
fingerprint" for each room and to identify the location of its occupants. One
would surmise that the seven microphones and the powerful speakers that the
Echo carries would make the device particularly well suited for echolocation,
tracking, and fingerprinting of domestic spaces.

In 2013, a group from MIT published a similar paper titled "See through walls
with WiFi!" "For many years humans have fantasized about X-ray vision," the
authors write. Could it be possible today, using Wi-Fi signals emitted by an
ordinary router? As it turns out, yes: "we present Wi-Vi, a wireless
technology that uses Wi-Fi signals to detect moving humans behind walls in
closed rooms." Just a few years ago, the very idea of mapping rooms with
microphones or tracking humans behind closed doors with Wi-Fi would be
relegated to the realm of an Ian Fleming novel. Further, the suggestion that
consumers would voluntarily place such capable devices in the middle of their
living rooms defies belief still, despite the evidence. Where a "bug" in a
hotel room caused scandals in the Nixon era, inviting a beastie that carries
13 antennas to the bedroom seems fine. Costumers will pay $170 for the
privilege. The fact that the Samsung Smart TV, America's best selling
television set, is routinely recording conversations, even when powered off
barely made the news. The terms and conditions policy that comes with the
device simply states: "Please be aware that if your spoken words include
personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the
data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice
Recognition."

*Exposed* sounds an early alarm about such practices and calls to action. If
we are to be watched, we must also be able to return the gaze. Forces of
capital and control have to grow transparent in proportion to our own
transparency. Who will watch the watchers? Acts of whistle-blowers like
Chelsea Manning and publishers like Julian Assange suggest a way forward. So
do strategies of obfuscation described in the recent volume by Finn Brunton
and Helen Nissenbaum. But can these isolated strategies amount to a broader
movement for digital resistance?  The book ends there, with a provocation to
the reader. Because the erosion of privacy and the rise of the expository
society happens through countless small, personal decisions, the answer must
involve a collective response with the participation of every digital subject.

What is to be done? Reading the book against the considerable archive of
Harcourt's writings on free markets, the occupy movement, and incarceration,
suggests several avenues for exploration in search for viable models of
dissent and disobedience.

First, the war. We must not forget that the state of affairs Harcourt
describes in his book is linked intimately with the armaments of perpetual
warfare. The expository society is born not out of technological contingencies
alone, but also out of the extraordinary measures evoked during wartime.  The
passage of the USA Patriot act in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the Snowden
revelations, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act tucked into the
spending bill passed by the Congress at the end of 2015---these are all
connected events the lead to the same source. The ill-conceived bargain at the
heart of all extraordinary measures would trade ideals central to democratic
governance for security. War forces the hand. We are told that if we do not
comply we would be vulnerable to grave danger. History tells us that rushed
measures during seemingly exceptional times were a favorite tool of tyrannies.
We do not live under a tyrannical regime today. Harcourt's book reminds us of
the danger of building infrastructures that could easily invite tyranny.

In light of this danger, itself as real as the violence of terrorism, I am
puzzled by the decline of the anti-war rhetoric. Anti-war movements that
defined a generation of conscientious dissenters are no longer a major
motivating force for the politically active. According to a recent Gallup poll
Americans worry most about issues like immigration, terrorism, income
inequality, drug use, the size and power of federal government, the economy,
and climate change. But not war. Violence is perhaps less palatable now
because it is hidden and dehumanized by the use of night vision and remote
drone warfare. But is it possible to restore the "lines between governance,
commerce, surveillance, and private life" at home without addressing
militarization abroad? I do not think so. Everything near is exposed in the
process of reaching for that hidden and remote threat of terrorism. The
perceived difficulty of blowing up an Afghani family on the "deposition
matrix," the US kill list, is used to justify the ease of domestic
surveillance. The one entails the other. Failing to cease the continual
projection of violence abroad, we will be unable to stop the erosion of the
civic society at home.

Second, the economy. The dissolution of the Soviet Union heralded the decline
of an ideology: namely statist socialism and centrally-planned economy. We
have yet to deal intellectually with the centralizing forces of capitalist
economies. Entities like Google, Amazon, Uber, and AirBnB exert immense
centralizing pressures on the marketplace, including the marketplace of ideas.
The technologies Harcourt outlines in his book are all in some way related to
the massive aggregation of data. They are both the cause and effect of
economies in the process of centralization. Again I ask, is it possible to
address massive surveillance programs without dealing with the underlying
monopolies in the marketplace of information? From the engineering systems
perspective, the alternative to such central structures is distribution. The
emergence of distributed technologies is marked by an attempt to decentralize
infrastructure. Witness Diaspora, a federated alternative to Facebook; bit
torrent, a system for decentralized file sharing; bitcoin, peer to peer money;
Library Genesis, community book collection and sharing; and Wikipedia, a
peer-produced Internet encyclopedia. The architecture of decentralized
communities follows a resurgent interest in the earlier, somewhat abortive
branch of anti-statist socialism. Figures like Mikhail Bakunin, Peter
Kropotkin, and Murray Bookchin figure prominently in the conversation about
technological resistance. A return to this intellectual tradition could fill
the critical void left in liberal thought by the decline of communism.

Finally, Harcourt's book makes it impossible not to feel complicit in the
system by which countless small voluntary transactions, in aggregate, bring
the expository society into existence. "Our desires and our passions have
enslaved us," Harcourt writes. The emotional affirmation that accompanies
exuberant social networking brings with it the very structures of surveillance
and control that are used widely by law enforcement and national security
agencies. As a community of readers and writers that value intellectual
independence, we must begin to align the sharp edge of critical theory with
our everyday practice. This includes the way we read, write, find, and share
information online. For people who spend so much time in front of our
computers in search for knowledge, we are remarkably alienated from the
material contexts of knowledge production. *Exposed* reminds us of an
uncomfortable truth at the center of everyday human--computer interaction. We
know so little about the smart machines that are keen observe us in our
kitchens, offices, and living rooms. Let's cultivate then a keen interest in
their literal deconstruction: to learn how they are made, where their wires
lead, and to strip the aura of fetishism that attaches itself to such dumb
devices.

Judging by consumer behavior, the magic machines that surround our everyday
life are still worth the price. They offer enough of a bargain to get past
most personal ethical objections. I have no evidence that Amazon or Google
intends to use their hubs and echoes for the purpose of surveillance. There is
no need to search for it either, because it is laid out openly, in the terms
of service. The point is not to vilify technology. Given the chance to better
see ourselves in the digital reflection, we will mount such mirrors in our
living rooms willingly. The balance between vanity and civic virtue will tilt
inevitably towards vanity. The burden of ethical reasoning lies on the part of
an informed public. But for now, being informed is less fun than watching a
smart TV. What is to be done? Harcourt does a masterful job at locating desire
as the key to the voluntary surveillance conundrum. Dissent will remain the
purview of the select few until the pain of tyranny overwhelms the pleasure of
ubiquitous connectivity for most.
